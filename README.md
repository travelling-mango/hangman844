### Description

- *Hangman* is a classic game involding two players - one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain number of attempts.

- This project executes a simple *Hangman* game in Python. It involves creating a list of fruits, randomly selecting a word from the list, and then prompting the player to guess the word by entering one letter at a time. Integrated input validation checks ensure that the player only inputs a single alphabetical character at a time, and a display function improves the user experience by showing which letters have been guessed correctly.

- The project aims to exhibit key skills and concepts in Python which include, but are not limited to: functions; for loops, iteration, and control flow;  classes; user-input handling; OOP (object-oriented programming); game logic; error handling; and debugging.

- Throughout this experience I have honed in the skills and concepts mentioned above, and learned how to apply them practically. This project has helped me grow confident in using Python.
